# Technology 

At the heart of Obscuro's innovative approach to blockchain encryption lies the pragmatic use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These TEEs are not just about encryption; they ensure unparalleled confidentiality while providing absolute certainty about the code in execution. This technology empowers Obscuro to deliver a unique blend of smart contracts, decentralization, scalability, and encryption, setting a new benchmark in the blockchain realm.

By integrating encryption directly into the Ethereum Mainnet, Obscuro harnesses the Mainnet's inherent liveness and availability, ensuring impeccable ledger integrity. But what truly sets Obscuro apart is its proprietary Proof of Block Inclusion (POBI) protocol. This groundbreaking protocol guarantees that Obscuro's confidential roll-ups achieve consensus within a decentralized Obscuro network, ensuring both security and transparency.
